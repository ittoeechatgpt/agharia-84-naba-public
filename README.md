# 🌿 Agharia Genealogy Subtree – The Legacy of Pritsingh Nayak

**"One branch. One legacy. A small but powerful story from the great tree of 84 Agharia families."**

This repository is a digital preservation effort of a **genealogical subset** within the historic **84 Agharia families believed to have migrated from Agra**. This particular lineage begins with **Pritsingh Nayak**, who lived approximately **6 generations above the researcher, Nabaratna Naik**, and **8 generations above the current maintainer**.

---

## 👴 About the Researcher

- **Nabaratna Naik**, an 80-year-old grandfather, has spent the last 7 years **collecting, verifying, and documenting** the family lineage — **door to door**, through **informal interviews**, and by scanning through **regional networks** across **Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Nagpur**, and beyond.
- He did all this using nothing but **Word and Excel**, with unwavering commitment, even as his fingers slowed.

✅ This project:
- Represents **a single family line (subtree)** from the broader **84 Agharia families**
- Begins from **Pritsingh Nayak** and traces **11 generations**
- Digitizes oral histories and manually collected records
- Brings in both **paternal and maternal** lineage mapping

❌ This project:
- Does **not claim to be a complete history of all 84 Agharia families**
- Does **not represent the root ancestor of the Agharia samaj**
